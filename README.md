# Basic-Text-Adventure-Game-
This program was a final project for Harrisburg University of Science and Technology for class CISC 120 - programming one
This is a game using class and functions to create a basic text adventure game where you can move through rooms and are given different actions to do.
It is not fully implemented correctly and is unfinished but if you would like a base or example of what to do you may look.
